# Vulkan Dynamic Rendering Sample

vdrs is my sample for dynamic rendering extension ( it's core in version 1.3 ) in vulkan.

### Libraries

[Vulkan SDK](https://lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) - Vulkan is a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern graphics processing units, which are used in a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones and embedded platforms.

[glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) - Open source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

### Installation

Compilation should work under g++14, clang18 and latest msvc.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eUltrabyte/vdrs.git
cd vdrs && mkdir Build
cd Build && cmake ..
```
After successful compilation you just need to run this sample.
